# Porfolio Site
A site to showcase some of the personal projects that I work on.  The site is live [here](https://theimberger.github.io/portfolio/).  The landing page was inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxWKffqBjMM) and intended to have a relaxing effect.

If you'd like to run the site locally you can pull this repo and run `npm i && npm start`.
